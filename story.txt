Title: Reality is nonsense. hello.
What is real may not actually 
be what is and as we create reality in front of us, 
that which is may not be while that which is is may very well be. 
Some which is may be created in reality by itself not actually being, 
the absence of one creates the existance of another 
and itself in reality and branches of that
The last line describes truth. So does the the first one.
